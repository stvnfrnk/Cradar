Definitions
***********


**Capacity**
  Capacitance is "the amount of charge a material can hold" for a given applied voltage


**Electric Permitivity**
  resistance of matter to an electric field

**Relative Electric Permitivity**
  The relative permittivity defines the dielectric properties of a material relative to that of free-space


**Dielectric permittivity**
  This physical property quantifies how easily material becomes polarized in the presence of an electric field.


**Dielectric Constant**
  usually 1 in a vacuum, but depends on material structure


**Relative Dielectric Constant**


____

Radio Waves
***********

* depends on the speed of light in free space ( 300.000 km / s)
* the relative electric constant
* the relative magnetic permeability ( 1 for non magnetic materials)
* for GPR purposes we often consider only dielectric permittivity (e) to influence velocity

Reflections

* depends on the contrast in dielectric constant (value of dielectric permittivity) of adjacent layers
* the higher â†’ more energy is reflected


**Attenuation**

Attenuation dictates how deep we can see, and is usually described in terms of a "skin depth".
Skin depth is the depth at which the field strength falls to 1/2.71828 (or 1/e) of its original amplitude.


**Scattering**



**Mie scattering...**
  is scattering of energy in a random matter for objects of the same wavelength as the radar signal


**Rayleigh scattering...**
  occurs when objects are smaller than the radar wavelength and produce 'clutter' noise


**Absorbtion**
  turning electromagnetic energy into heat
